    <h1>The OVAL Schema for jOVAL</h1>
    <p>The OVAL schema for jOVAL is a set of classes generated using JAXB, using the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/version5.9/">XSD schemas</a> published by MITRE.  The schemas have been minimally annotated for compilation in order to prevent namespace collisions with elements named &quot;version&quot in the definitions schemas.  When this has been done, corresponding annotations have been made to the corresponding systemcharacterics schema so that states and items can be compared freely as if they were corresponding bean-like containers.</p>
    <p>Each XSD is translated into a set of Java classes, with a mapping of one Java package per XSD.</p>
