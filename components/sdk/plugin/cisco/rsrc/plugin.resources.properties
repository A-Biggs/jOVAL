\nConfiguration Options for the Cisco Offline Plugin:\
\n   The Cisco offline plugin is designed to perform OVAL assessments for IOS\
\n   devices without directly contacting the device. It uses an externally-\
\n   provided file as input.\
\n\
\n   The plugin is configured using the -config <file> option of jovaldi. The\
\n   <file> argument should point to a Java .properties file, which is a text\
\n   file consisting of name/value property pairs delimited by line-breaks. Each\
\n   line is of the format name=value. Comments may be placed in the file by\
\n   beginning a line with a #-mark, which will cause the line to be ignored. The\
\n   following property names are defined for the Cisco offline plugin:\
\n\
\n   Property Name   Description\
\n   -------------   ------------------------------------------------------------\
\n   tech.url        A URL to a resource containing the output of the command\
\n                   "show tech-support".  Alternatively, a path to a file can be\
\n                   specified.
