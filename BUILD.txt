BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR jOVAL:

The jOVAL data models can be built using GNU make, but you must first modify
the "customize.mk" file to tailor the build to your environment. Simply
follow the instructions documented in the file.

After editing the customization file you can make the default target from the
project root directory. This will create the distributable JAR files containing
the data model classes resource files.
