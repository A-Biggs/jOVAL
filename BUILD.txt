BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR jOVAL:

jOVAL can be built from source code using GNU make, but you must first modify
the "customize.mk" file to tailor the build to your environment. Simply
follow the instructions documented in the file.

After editing the customization file you can make the default target from the
components/ directory. This will create a distribution of the product under
components/jovaldi/dist/[ARCH].

For an expedited re-build (i.e., if you have only made a simple change in a few
.java source files), you can use the "rebuild" target in the components
directory.
