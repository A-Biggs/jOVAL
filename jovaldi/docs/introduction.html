    <h1>The jOVAL Definition Interpreter</h1>
    <p>jOVAL is an implementation of <a href="http://oval.mitre.org">OVAL</a> in the Java programming language.  jovaldi is an OVAL definition interpreter that is implemented within the jOVAL library, that is intended to function as a drop-in replacement for MITRE's public-domain reference implementation, <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/interpreter.html">ovaldi</a>.</p>
    <p>The primary advantage of jovaldi over ovaldi is that jovaldi features a remote-scanning plug-in, and therefore, it need not be installed on the hosts that it scans.  For more information, please see the <a href="http://www.joval.org/di">jovaldi product page</a></p>
