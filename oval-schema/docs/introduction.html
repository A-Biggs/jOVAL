    <h1>The OVAL Schema for jOVAL</h1>
    <p>The OVAL schema for jOVAL is a set of classes generated using JAXB, using the <a href="http://oval.mitre.org/language/version5.9/">XSD schemas</a> published by MITRE.  The schemas have been minimally annotated for compilation in order to prevent namespace collisions.  Each XSD is translated into a set of Java classes, with a mapping of one Java package per XSD.</p>
