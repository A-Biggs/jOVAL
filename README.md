jOVAL&trade;: OVAL&reg; implemented in Java&trade;. For free.
=============

jOVAL has the potential to let you scan any machine, from any other machine.

The jOVAL library provides a comprehensive OVAL data model, an OVAL document processing engine, plug-in implementations for both remote and local scanning, and adapter implementations supporting many OVAL object types.  It is intended to be used in applications that call for an embedded OVAL interpreter.
