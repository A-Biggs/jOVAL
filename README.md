jOVAL&trade;: SCAP Simplified.
=============

jOVAL makes it possible to scan any machine, from any other machine.

The jOVAL library provides comprehensive data models for all the SCAP specification languages, XCCDF and OVAL document processing engines, plug-in implementations for local, remote and offline scanning, and adapter implementations supporting over 100 OVAL object types.  It is intended to be used in applications that call for an embedded OVAL or SCAP capability.
