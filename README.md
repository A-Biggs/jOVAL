OVAL implemented in Java. For free.
=============

jOVAL has the potential to let you scan any machine, from any other machine.

The jOVAL library provides a comprehensive OVAL data model, an OVAL document processing engine, and plug-in implementations of various OVAL test evaluators.  It is intended to be used in applications that call for an embedded OVAL interpreter with remote scanning capabilities, although both local and remote sessions are implemented.

jOVALdi is a command-line OVAL definition interpreter. It was originally written as a sample app to demonstrate the use of the jOVAL library, but it is a powerful utility in and of itself.
